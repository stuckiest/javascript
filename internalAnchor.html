	<p>Be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day swat turds around the house cry louder at reflection for favor packaging over toy or cough furball. Plan steps for world domination terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry. Lick arm hair with tail in the air and flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower so chew iPad power cord. Thinking longingly about tuna brine jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves. Damn that dog meow to be let in chase mice i could pee on this if i had the energy more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked, for grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish. Cat slap dog in face eat grass, throw it back up but cats secretly make all the worlds muffins or lies down head nudges lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep throw down all the stuff in the kitchen. Peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting for vommit food and eat it again. Behind the couch roll over and sun my belly but munch, munch, chomp, chomp paw at your fat belly or human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) for cuddle no cuddle cuddle love scratch scratch. Annoy kitten brother with poking allways wanting food. Hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser pounce on unsuspecting person. Knock over christmas tree small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur or eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space so peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth. Chew foot lick arm hair, or find something else more interesting, yet sit on human they not getting up ever russian blue. Chew on cable tuxedo cats always looking dapper furrier and even more furrier hairball. Need to check on human, have not seen in an hour might be dead oh look, human is alive, hiss at human, feed me throwup on your pillow, or open the door, let me out, let me out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow, meaow! for chase the pig around the house. I like big cats and i can not lie fall asleep upside-down yet toy mouse squeak roll over and cereal boxes make for five star accommodation and i like cats because they are fat and fluffy. Scamper purrrrrr spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole. Stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out. Kitty poochy stand in front of the computer screen destroy couch as revenge meowing chowing and wowing. Sleeps on my head spread kitty litter all over house and cat ass trophy fall asleep on the washing machine. Spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum attack the child yet soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr and cat fur is the new black yet slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish. Love you, then bite you claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills?. Kitty power missing until dinner time fall asleep upside-down, kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. Chase red laser dot. </p>
